    <h1>My Story</h1>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">I was an ordinary kid. I played with toys, broke things, rebuilt them, and did anything that caught my interest. Fun fact: when I was learning to recognize colors, my favorite question was, "So what kind of red is this?" My parents always said, "Zbyněčku, that's not red..." But I ignored them and kept asking the same question again.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  When I was two years old, my right eye started to protrude. My mom was concerned, so she took me to the doctor. I was diagnosed with an optic glioma – a rare type of brain tumor affecting the optic nerve. It's considered a form of cancer. Because of it, I had to undergo surgery. Although the tumor was removed, it left one irreversible consequence – I lost vision in my right eye. How do I feel about it? I don't know. I was only two years old and don’t remember what it was like to see with both eyes. I only know that since then, my peripheral vision has been limited, and my right eyelid has remained partially closed.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  Still, I kept doing everything I could. I started wearing glasses to protect my eye and went for an MRI every six months to ensure everything was okay. From the age of five, when I started playing football, sports became a big part of my life — and over time, I got involved in many others too. In kindergarten, I constantly asked the teachers, “And why?" While my parents happily explained things to me at home, the kindergarten staff wasn’t so thrilled. They even told my mom, "If we had to answer all the kids’ questions like that, we'd go crazy."</p>

  </div>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  At six, I had to undergo another surgery to remove the remaining part of the tumor. Again, everything went well. I was born on September 2nd 2003, so I had a natural deferral before starting school. But the kindergarten principal wanted to delay it another year, saying I still wasn’t ready. My mom disagreed. She told her I was bored in kindergarten and ready to move on. I didn’t even want to nap after lunch anymore — instead, I would spend the time throwing a single toy back and forth with a friend across about ten beds, whenever the teacher wasn’t around. Because of the disagreement, I had to visit a child psychologist. I solved puzzles and answered questions — and it was confirmed that I was more than ready for school. The real issue was the principal. A few times, I even overheard her making comments about me behind my back — she clearly didn’t have much of a liking for me and never really said anything nice.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  At age seven, I began attending elementary school. Reading was a challenge at first, but my teacher reassured my mom it would come with time — and it did. I remember one event in particular: we had to read syllables in front of our parents. The class was divided — strong readers had to read four syllables, and beginners only three. I was in the beginner group. But when it was my turn, the teacher unexpectedly pointed to a fourth syllable. I was surprised but kept going. I pulled it off, and the parents applauded. Even though I felt tricked, I now see it as an early lesson: life doesn’t always give us a heads-up.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  One day, a scout leader named Maskot visited our class. He spoke about scouting, and I was hooked. Meetings were on Fridays, but I was already in a local folk-dancing group called Pálavěnka — where kids danced in traditional costumes to folk music. My mom wasn’t thrilled about me missing it, but my dad said, “Let him try Scouts.” So I did — and never went back to folk dancing.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  Scouting opened up a new world — games, trips, nature, challenges. I needed a scout nickname, and since I admired the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), which lives in our region of Pálava, I became Bubo. At my first summer camp, older scouts were working toward a badge called "Three White Fangs," which involved three big tasks: a courage night trail, a 9 km hike, and spending seven hours alone in the forest. I was scared to sign up. But the scout leader could nominate someone — and Maskot picked me. It felt like being Harry Potter when his name was drawn from the Goblet of Fire.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  I completed all three tasks. During the solo forest challenge, I ate all my food at the start and was bored the rest of the time. The night walk back alone was terrifying. The hike was exhausting, and we nearly got lost. But I made it — and earned the badge, considered one of the hardest for our age group.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  In second grade, I joined a floorball club Mikulov where my friends already played. I trained twice a week, continued scouting, and kept up with sports. From first to fifth grade, I always climbed the rope fastest and competed in school races. I placed fourth every year until fifth grade, when I finally came in first. I also took part in a poetry contest and placed third. Singing, however, wasn’t my strength — even though I gave it a real shot. My sister is a great singer and took lessons with a vocal coach. Although my mom warned him that I couldn’t sing, he didn’t want to judge too soon and decided to give me a chance. So, I started going to singing lessons too. While he played the piano, I trained my voice, preparing for my first performance. I practiced a lot. When the big day came, I stepped onto the stage, bowed, and the teacher began playing. I started singing — everything was going smoothly… until the audience suddenly burst out laughing. I didn’t know why, but I just kept going. Afterward, I asked my mom what had happened. She told me I had skipped an entire verse, and since everyone knew the song, it struck them as funny. Oh well — these things happen. I kept attending lessons for a little while longer until one day the vocal coach politely told my mom that he didn’t have much left to teach me — a kind way of saying singing just wasn’t for me. So yes, now it’s pretty clear that my musical ear operates on… a different frequency. (sad kappa)</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  In scouts, I became the leader of the Yellow Pack. By that time, some of my classmates had also joined scouts, including a few who used to tease me at school — mostly about my eye. Sometimes I brushed it off, other times it hurt, but I rarely let it show. One of those classmates had recorded a video of me back in second grade during a school trip. I was laughing kind of weird — nothing extreme, just a typical kid being silly. But in fourth grade, they dug up that video and started using it to mock me, over and over. It got to me. I stood up for myself, but it’s hard when you're one kid against three.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  As luck would have it, that same classmate ended up in my scout pack — and I became his leader. We were divided into smaller teams that competed against each other. During one camp, we played a series of games where before each round, someone from the group had to be chosen to potentially receive either a random advantage or a disadvantage — like being blindfolded or having their legs tied. As the team leader, I got to choose who from our team would draw the slip. Naturally, I always picked him. In one game, he had to hop with bound legs. In another, he started with fewer lives than anyone else. I could tell it wore him down — he came home from that camp drained and frustrated. But maybe, just maybe, it gave him a small taste of what it feels like to be singled out. Not revenge — more like justice. A lesson in empathy.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  In fifth grade, I decided to apply to a grammar school in Mikulov like my sister. I studied hard and got in — barely. I ranked 28th out of 30 admitted. Some of my classmates also got in, and for a while, the teasing and bullying stopped.
  At the same time, I started hanging out with older friends who worked out on public bars and playgrounds. They did calisthenics/street workout — exercises with your own body weight — and I found it super cool. I was overweight and couldn’t even do a single pull-up. When I tried Australian pull-ups, one of the older friends had to place his hands behind my back to help me finish a rep. That’s how it started.
  I was still in scouts, but by then I had moved into the older age group — the Dingos. We had something called “Stezky,” which were booklets full of challenges and tasks to complete. On one page, I had to choose one challenge from a few options: 30 days without using elevators, 14 days without computer games, 30 days without sweets, and so on. I actually picked two — even though we were supposed to pick just one. I chose 14 days without computer games and 30 days without sweets. My logic was that if I failed one, at least I might complete the other.
  So I quit sweets and video games cold turkey. After about 8 days, I realized I really missed gaming and decided to drop that challenge and focus entirely on the no-sweets one. I played a game, which meant there was no going back — if I wanted to complete the task, it had to be sweets-free.
  I made it to 30 days. Then 2 months. Then 6. Then a year. And before I knew it, I had gone two years without eating sweets. Maybe I slipped once, but if so, I honestly can’t remember. It became part of my identity.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  At the same time, I threw myself into training. I found a 21-day challenge online and gave it a go. The first 7 days were free, and after that, well… you can probably guess I just kept going in my own way. I learned mostly from YouTube videos and tried every type of movement I came across — pull-ups, push-up variations, handstand progressions. Bit by bit, I got stronger, my weight dropped, and I became addicted to street workout.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  I mentioned that the bullying had stopped for a while — well, it eventually came back. Even in scouts. It hit me hard, and I even considered quitting. But thanks to my leaders, we managed to talk it out, patch things up, and it stopped. We’re all still friends to this day — so at least there’s a good ending to that chapter.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  At the age of 15, I joined Bulldogs Brno, a floorball club — fulfilling my dream of playing for them. I had trained with them over the summer, joined a few sessions, and finally got the chance to be drafted. That moment was the fulfillment of a childhood dream. I was in great shape by then — working out nearly every day, eating clean, measuring my meals, taking cold showers, and using a foam roller for recovery.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  In my debut match, I was placed as the center in the first line. The referee blew the whistle, I won the faceoff, and the play began. Our defenders passed the ball, then to the wing, back to me, back to him, and then to me again — boom. I scored just 17 seconds into the game. I still remember the feeling — pure flow. Everything clicked. I had arrived.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  Unfortunately, my second tournament didn’t go so smoothly. During a match, I went for a faceoff, struggled but won the ball, and broke through the opponents’ defense. As I was darting between two players, I tripped and landed awkwardly on my right leg. A sharp jolt of pain shot up my body, and I collapsed. My right leg just wouldn't respond. I tried getting up, but it wouldn’t move. A nurse who was present at the game came over. She assumed it was just a bruise or that my leg was stiff, so she began massaging and stretching it — but it only made things worse. She asked if I had stretched properly before the match. I told her I had: both earlier that day at home and again during the warm-up with the team. I had definitely stretched enough. Still, the pain got worse, and nothing seemed to help. Eventually, my mom stepped in and told my coach she was taking me to the hospital. While waiting for the scans, I sat on a bed, tears in my eyes. It hurt more and more, and the shooting pains continued. The nurse and doctor tried to calm me down, telling me not to cry — that it was probably just a bruise or some stiffness, and that I should stop making a fuss because I was a big boy now. Their tone wasn’t exactly comforting — it felt more dismissive than reassuring. (By the way, people sometimes ask if I cry from both eyes even though I only see from one — yes, I cry from both.)

  Then the results came in: I had dislocated my hip and even had a slight fracture in the socket. Suddenly, everyone went quiet. </p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  Typically, surgery would have been delayed because I’d had breakfast that morning. But a doctor feared of some damage and decided to operate immediately. To be honest, I was relieved — I just wanted the pain to stop.
  After surgery, I woke up in a hospital bed with a leather boot strapped to my leg, connected to hanging weights. The pain was gone — finally some peace. But when the doctor told me I wouldn’t be able to play floorball for at least six months, I broke down. Floorball and training were everything to me — hearing that was crushing.</p>

  <div class="image-row">
    <a href="images/boot.JPG" target="_blank">

    </a>
  </div>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  At first, I had to lie still for six weeks. The boot, unfortunately, dug painfully into my heel and kept me from sleeping. So they opted for another solution: they inserted a screw below my knee and attached the weight directly to that. The setup involved a strange pulley system hanging off the side of the bed. It looked kind of funny, honestly.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">During those first days in the hospital, something really special happened — my friends from Bulldogs, the floorball team, came to visit me. It meant a lot. We talked, laughed, and it really lifted my spirits during a time when everything felt uncertain and heavy. Just knowing they hadn’t forgotten about me gave me motivation to stay strong and keep going.</p>
  
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  After two weeks, I was allowed to go home by ambulance and continue resting in Mikulov. After another four weeks, I returned to the hospital to learn how to walk on crutches — without putting any weight on my right leg. Even standing on my healthy leg caused pins and needles and cramps.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  Before I had even mastered the crutches, I was sent for a four-week rehab stay in Klimkovice. On my second day, I was heading to my first group program, which all the kids were supposed to attend. In Klimkovice, there are two buildings: A for adults and B for children, connected by a tunnel. A boy who had already been staying there for a while was assigned to guide me. As I hobbled behind him on my crutches, I accidentally stepped on his sliding slipper, lost balance, and instinctively tried to land on my injured leg. I fell and lay there on the floor, staring at my trembling leg, afraid I had messed something up again.
  After a few moments, once I had calmed down a bit, the boy helped me get up, and we continued to building A — only to find it completely empty. Turns out the program was actually in our original building, B. As we were walking back, we ran into a caretaker who scolded the boy for leading me to the wrong place. </p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  Later, I decided to tell the caretakers about my fall — my knee had started to swell, and it didn’t look great. A doctor came to examine me, and since I had previously injured my hip, they decided it was better to send me to the hospital just to be sure. At the hospital, they checked me over — I could still move the leg and there was no real pain — so they gave me a cream and sent me back. The boy who had guided me got scolded again, even though both he and I kept explaining it hadn’t been his fault. That really bothered me.</p>
  <p class="spaced-paragraph">
  By that point, I hadn’t eaten all day. A special meal had supposedly been set aside for me, but someone forgot. Maybe someone got yelled at again — because as an "apology," they brought me three big servings of pasta with meat. I devoured every bite. That’s how my stay in Klimkovice began.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">At the spa, I went for different treatments every day. Some days it was back massages, baths with iodine-bromine water, or spiral relaxation, etc. Twice a week, I also exercised on a motomed, and every day I had one-on-one sessions with a teacher and studied for school. The focus was mainly on math and Czech, plus foreign languages. There were about 10 of us in one class, and the teacher worked with each of us individually. That part was great. I’m not even talking about the fact that some of us were from grammar schools and some weren’t — the important thing is that everyone could work at their own pace and didn’t have to wait for anything. If I didn’t understand something, the teacher explained it to me and we moved on.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">One time I asked a physiotherapist if it was okay to do squats on my healthy leg — she said yes, so I learned to do pistol squats again by using the toilet as support. I also asked if I could do push-ups with my right leg lifted. She said yes. So I started doing push-ups too. I even have a video from the spa on my Facebook. I still remember how a friend told me that some classmates said I was a “dumbass” after seeing the video — that I had barely started walking with crutches and I was already working out. It just shows how addicted I was to training.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Four weeks at the spa flew by, and I went home for Christmas. After Christmas, when I came back to school still using crutches, I realized I was ahead of the class in math. Pretty interesting, considering I got injured on October 8th and didn’t start seriously studying math until the spa stay. While I was stuck at home with my leg, I only studied occasionally. Even though it might have seemed like lying around was fine, it wasn’t really. I wasn’t used to sleeping on my back, and I couldn’t really sleep on my side. I could barely turn my leg, so sleep was quite uncomfortable.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">While I was still recovering at home, the hospital told me I could lift my healthy left leg and move it a bit so it wouldn’t weaken too much. So every other day I worked out for about half an hour. I strapped a 0.5 kg weight to my healthy leg and lifted it up and down. That allowed me to strengthen it a bit, along with my core. Even though I hadn’t really used dumbbells much before, I used a pair of 2 kg dumbbells we had at home to train my arms at least a little.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Back to returning to school. After about a week of going to school, I had a scheduled follow-up appointment in Brno. There, they told me to try walking on both feet again. I just stared at them for a moment, afraid to even try. Eventually, I started slowly testing it. At first, I felt quite a lot of cramps and pain under my foot as I tried to put weight on it. Just being able to stand on my right leg again felt amazing. That same day, I slowly and carefully began to walk again.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">During the check-up, they told me I couldn’t run for another five months, so I still couldn’t play floorball. One of my friends was going to a trainer at a gym and told me they have "open sessions" — times when anyone can come and train however they want, using whatever equipment they like. There were pull-up bars and all kinds of stuff, so we could basically do whatever training we felt like. So I started going with him to those open sessions and gradually returned to street workout.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Eventually, I began attending regular training sessions with that coach, who worked with each person individually based on their abilities and goals. Because I had been walking with crutches, my spine was slightly curved and I had mild scoliosis, so he helped me work on fixing that too.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Honestly, I was never much into weight training. I was never interested in lifting heavy weights, doing deadlifts, bench presses, etc. But I wanted to at least learn proper bench press technique so I wouldn’t hurt my back. So he trained me in that too. What’s interesting is that I first learned the bench press movement on the floor using two 8 kg kettlebells. Only after gradually increasing weight did I move on to the actual bench press.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">I find it cool that I started this way, because so often people just get shoved straight under the barbell, shown the form once, and that’s it. I learned it slowly and carefully, which I think is safer and better.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">During those sessions, once a year, there was a competition called Iron Heart. Individuals competed against each other, earning points for specific exercises based on how many repetitions they could do. My first Iron Heart was fun. For example, we did one-legged squats (pistol squats). When I had done just over twenty, someone said I still needed to confirm it with my weaker leg. When I replied, "This is my weaker leg," everyone burst out laughing. Like I said — it was fun.  (By the way, doing over twenty pistol squats isn’t anything special. If I remember correctly, several girls there easily did over thirty.)  I ended up winning my first Iron Heart. I mostly had the advantage because many of the exercises that year were ones I was already used to — pull-ups, push-ups, pistol squats, L-sit holds, and so on. The next year, I finished third. </p>

    </a>
  </div>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Outside of training sessions, I also returned more and more to street workout. Even when I was finally able to run again, I seriously started thinking whether floorball was something I still wanted to pursue seriously — and it just wasn’t anymore. If I ever played again, it would be just for fun. I never went back to competitive floorball.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">For a year and a half, I went to conditioning training sessions in Mikulov until COVID hit. Then the trainings stopped. School slowly moved online. During COVID, things were quite interesting. Our school schedule shifted a bit, so in the mornings, before online classes started, I’d go running with friends to the quarry and take a dip in ice-cold water — and then run back home. I’d usually get back about ten minutes before school started, so I’d end up eating breakfast during the first lesson.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">As a kid, I enjoyed watching anime on TV. I don’t know if it was out of boredom or just randomly, but I got back into anime again. I started watching it almost nonstop and became quite addicted to it. But thanks to watching anime — and especially AMVs on YouTube — I also got into editing my own AMVs. I would literally spend 10 hours on my phone editing AMVs right on the device.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Sometimes my parents would come into my room and see me staring at my phone for hours. They always had something to say about it. I usually brushed it off and didn’t tell them I was editing videos. When I learn to do something new, I rarely talk about it right away. I prefer to do things in the background. That gives me more peace and lets me work at my own pace without being constantly questioned. They didn’t even find out I was learning to edit until over a year later, when I started editing on a laptop. My fingers were starting to hurt from using the phone so much, and doing everything on a computer is just easier — let’s be honest.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">After the pandemic, I didn’t return to my conditioning workouts, but I started working out freely on my own. But it wasn’t like I slacked off. Quite the opposite — I would say I hit my peak back then. I could do one-arm pull-up, back lever, handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, and more. So alongside working out, I was watching a lot of anime and learning video editing.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Eventually, I reached my final year of high school and faced my graduation exams. Since I had earned the Cambridge FCE (B2) certificate in my junior year, I only had to take the written English test for graduation. But the FCE certificate wasn’t as easy for me as it might seem. I had a lot of struggles with English, even though playing computer games like Minecraft, CS:GO, etc., helped me a lot. I also used Duolingo, which I completed entirely. I got a few certificates from onlinejazyky.cz, learned from webpage 2000slovicek.cz, and did more related things. Eventually, I passed the FCE exam.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">The other subjects I graduated in were math, Czech, and computer science. For Czech, I mostly used the website learntube.cz, where I selected books that Mr. Tomáš Ficza talked about in his video courses. I read all of them in digital form, completed the entire learntube course, and was quite well prepared for the Czech graduation exam. Whatever wasn’t covered in the course, I learned separately — mainly author biographies — and that was it. I drew Romeo, Juliet and Darkness for my oral exam, which went fine.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">Next was math. I didn’t take the state exam but rather the school version, which meant solving a 3-hour written test. I mostly studied for that on the site realisticky.cz, and I just barely passed. (More on my math situation when I talk about my first year at university.)</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">The computer science exam was fairly simple. Some topics, like flip-flops, took a while to learn, but I already knew a lot of the material myself. I drew a question on input and output devices of a computer — not much more to say about that.</p>

  <p class="spaced-paragraph">So in the end, I managed to get through graduation and went off to university.</p>
