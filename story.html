    <h1>My Story</h1>

    <p>I was an ordinary kid. I played with toys, broke things, rebuilt them, and did anything that caught my interest. Fun fact: when I was learning to recognize colors, my favorite question was, "So what kind of red is this?" My parents always said, "Zbyněčku, that's not red..." But I ignored them and kept asking the same question again.</p>

<p>
When I was two years old, my right eye started to protrude. My mom was concerned, so she took me to the doctor. I was diagnosed with an optic glioma – a rare type of brain tumor affecting the optic nerve. It's considered a form of cancer. Because of it, I had to undergo surgery. Although the tumor was removed, it left one irreversible consequence – I lost vision in my right eye. How do I feel about it? I don't know. I was only two years old and don’t remember what it was like to see with both eyes. I only know that since then, my peripheral vision has been limited, and my right eyelid has remained partially closed.</p>
<p>
Still, I kept doing everything I could. I started wearing glasses to protect my eye and went for an MRI every six months to ensure everything was okay. From the age of five, when I started playing football, sports became a big part of my life — and over time, I got involved in many others too. In kindergarten, I constantly asked the teachers, “And why?" While my parents happily explained things to me at home, the kindergarten staff wasn’t so thrilled. They even told my mom, "If we had to answer all the kids’ questions like that, we'd go crazy."</p>

<p>
At six, I had to undergo another surgery to remove the remaining part of the tumor. Again, everything went well. I was born on September 2nd, so I had a natural deferral before starting school. But the kindergarten principal wanted to delay it another year, saying I still wasn’t ready. My mom disagreed. She told her I was bored in kindergarten and ready to move on. I didn’t even want to nap after lunch anymore — instead, I would spend the time throwing a single toy back and forth with a friend across about ten beds, whenever the teacher wasn’t around. Because of the disagreement, I had to visit a child psychologist. I solved puzzles and answered questions — and it was confirmed that I was more than ready for school. The real issue was the principal. A few times, I even overheard her making comments about me behind my back — she clearly didn’t have much of a liking for me and never really said anything nice.</p>
<p>
At age seven, I began attending elementary school. Reading was a challenge at first, but my teacher reassured my mom it would come with time — and it did. I remember one event in particular: we had to read syllables in front of our parents. The class was divided — strong readers had to read four syllables, and beginners only three. I was in the beginner group. But when it was my turn, the teacher unexpectedly pointed to a fourth syllable. I was surprised but kept going. I pulled it off, and the parents applauded. Even though I felt tricked, I now see it as an early lesson: life doesn’t always give us a heads-up.</p>
<p>
One day, a scout leader named Maskot visited our class. He spoke about scouting, and I was hooked. Meetings were on Fridays, but I was already in a local folk-dancing group called Pálavěnka — where kids danced in traditional costumes to folk music. My mom wasn’t thrilled about me missing it, but my dad said, “Let him try Scouts.” So I did — and never went back to folk dancing.</p>
<p>
Scouting opened up a new world — games, trips, nature, challenges. I needed a scout nickname, and since I admired the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), which lives in our region of Pálava, I became Bubo. At my first summer camp, older scouts were working toward a badge called "Three White Fangs," which involved three big tasks: a courage night trail, a 9 km hike, and spending seven hours alone in the forest. I was scared to sign up. But the scout leader could nominate someone — and Maskot picked me. It felt like being Harry Potter when his name was drawn from the Goblet of Fire.</p>
<p>
I completed all three tasks. During the solo forest challenge, I ate all my food at the start and was bored the rest of the time. The night walk back alone was terrifying. The hike was exhausting, and we nearly got lost. But I made it — and earned the badge, considered one of the hardest for our age group.</p>
<p>
In second grade, I joined a floorball club Mikulov where my friends already played. I trained twice a week, continued scouting, and kept up with sports. From first to fifth grade, I always climbed the rope fastest and competed in school races. I placed fourth every year until fifth grade, when I finally came in first. I also took part in a poetry contest and placed third. Singing, however, wasn’t my strength — even though I gave it a real shot. My sister is a great singer and took lessons with a vocal coach. Although my mom warned him that I couldn’t sing, he didn’t want to judge too soon and decided to give me a chance. So, I started going to singing lessons too. While he played the piano, I trained my voice, preparing for my first performance. I practiced a lot. When the big day came, I stepped onto the stage, bowed, and the teacher began playing. I started singing — everything was going smoothly… until the audience suddenly burst out laughing. I didn’t know why, but I just kept going. Afterward, I asked my mom what had happened. She told me I had skipped an entire verse, and since everyone knew the song, it struck them as funny. Oh well — these things happen. I kept attending lessons for a little while longer until one day the vocal coach politely told my mom that he didn’t have much left to teach me — a kind way of saying singing just wasn’t for me. So yes, now it’s pretty clear that my musical ear operates on… a different frequency. (sad kappa)</p>
<p>
In scouts, I became the leader of the Yellow Pack. By that time, some of my classmates had also joined scouts, including a few who used to tease me at school — mostly about my eye. Sometimes I brushed it off, other times it hurt, but I rarely let it show. One of those classmates had recorded a video of me back in second grade during a school trip. I was laughing kind of weird — nothing extreme, just a typical kid being silly. But in fourth grade, they dug up that video and started using it to mock me, over and over. It got to me. I stood up for myself, but it’s hard when you're one kid against three.</p>
<p>
As luck would have it, that same classmate ended up in my scout pack — and I became his leader. We were divided into smaller teams that competed against each other. During one camp, we played a series of games where before each round, someone from the group had to be chosen to potentially receive either a random advantage or a disadvantage — like being blindfolded or having their legs tied. As the team leader, I got to choose who from our team would draw the slip. Naturally, I always picked him. In one game, he had to hop with bound legs. In another, he started with fewer lives than anyone else. I could tell it wore him down — he came home from that camp drained and frustrated. But maybe, just maybe, it gave him a small taste of what it feels like to be singled out. Not revenge — more like justice. A lesson in empathy.</p>
<p>
In fifth grade, I decided to apply to a grammar school like my sister. I studied hard and got in — barely. I ranked 28th out of 30 admitted. Some of my classmates also got in, and for a while, the teasing and bullying stopped.
At the same time, I started hanging out with older friends who worked out on public bars and playgrounds. They did calisthenics/street workout — exercises with your own body weight — and I found it super cool. I was overweight and couldn’t even do a single pull-up. When I tried Australian pull-ups, one of the older friends had to place his hands behind my back to help me finish a rep. That’s how it started.
I was still in scouts, but by then I had moved into the older age group — the Dingos. We had something called “Stezky,” which were booklets full of challenges and tasks to complete. On one page, I had to choose one challenge from a few options: 30 days without using elevators, 14 days without computer games, 30 days without sweets, and so on. I actually picked two — even though we were supposed to pick just one. I chose 14 days without computer games and 30 days without sweets. My logic was that if I failed one, at least I might complete the other.
So I quit sweets and video games cold turkey. After about 8 days, I realized I really missed gaming and decided to drop that challenge and focus entirely on the no-sweets one. I played a game, which meant there was no going back — if I wanted to complete the task, it had to be sweets-free.
I made it to 30 days. Then 2 months. Then 6. Then a year. And before I knew it, I had gone two years without eating sweets. Maybe I slipped once, but if so, I honestly can’t remember. It became part of my identity.</p>
<p>
At the same time, I threw myself into training. I found a 21-day challenge online and gave it a go. The first 7 days were free, and after that, well… you can probably guess I just kept going in my own way. I learned mostly from YouTube videos and tried every type of movement I came across — pull-ups, push-up variations, handstand progressions. Bit by bit, I got stronger, my weight dropped, and I became addicted to street workout.</p>
<p>
I mentioned that the bullying had stopped for a while — well, it eventually came back. Even in scouts. It hit me hard, and I even considered quitting. But thanks to my leaders, we managed to talk it out, patch things up, and it stopped. We’re all still friends to this day — so at least there’s a good ending to that chapter.</p>
<p>
At the age of 15, I joined Bulldogs Brno, a floorball club — fulfilling my dream of playing for them. I had trained with them over the summer, joined a few sessions, and finally got the chance to be drafted. That moment was the fulfillment of a childhood dream. I was in great shape by then — working out nearly every day, eating clean, measuring my meals, taking cold showers, and using a foam roller for recovery.</p>
<p>
In my debut match, I was placed as the center in the first line. The referee blew the whistle, I won the faceoff, and the play began. Our defenders passed the ball, then to the wing, back to me, back to him, and then to me again — boom. I scored just 17 seconds into the game. I still remember the feeling — pure flow. Everything clicked. I had arrived.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, my second tournament didn’t go so smoothly. During a match, I went for a faceoff, struggled but won the ball, and broke through the opponents’ defense. As I was darting between two players, I tripped and landed awkwardly on my right leg. A sharp jolt of pain shot up my body, and I collapsed. My right leg just wouldn't respond. I tried getting up, but it wouldn’t move. A nurse who was present at the game came over. She assumed it was just a bruise or that my leg was stiff, so she began massaging and stretching it — but it only made things worse. She asked if I had stretched properly before the match. I told her I had: both earlier that day at home and again during the warm-up with the team. I had definitely stretched enough. Still, the pain got worse, and nothing seemed to help. Eventually, my mom stepped in and told my coach she was taking me to the hospital. While waiting for the scans, I sat on a bed, tears in my eyes. It hurt more and more, and the shooting pains continued. The nurse and doctor tried to calm me down, telling me not to cry — that it was probably just a bruise or some stiffness, and that I should stop making a fuss because I was a big boy now. Their tone wasn’t exactly comforting — it felt more dismissive than reassuring. (By the way, people sometimes ask if I cry from both eyes even though I only see from one — yes, I cry from both.)

Then the results came in: I had dislocated my hip and even had a slight fracture in the socket. Suddenly, everyone went quiet. </p>
<p>
Typically, surgery would have been delayed because I’d had breakfast that morning. But a doctor feared of some damage and decided to operate immediately. To be honest, I was relieved — I just wanted the pain to stop.
After surgery, I woke up in a hospital bed with a leather boot strapped to my leg, connected to hanging weights. The pain was gone — finally some peace. But when the doctor told me I wouldn’t be able to play floorball for at least six months, I broke down. Floorball and training were everything to me — hearing that was crushing.</p>
<p>
At first, I had to lie still for six weeks. The boot, unfortunately, dug painfully into my heel and kept me from sleeping. So they opted for another solution: they inserted a screw below my knee and attached the weight directly to that. The setup involved a strange pulley system hanging off the side of the bed. It looked kind of funny, honestly. (Maybe I’ll share a photo someday.)</p>
<p>
After two weeks, I was allowed to go home by ambulance and continue resting in Mikulov. After another four weeks, I returned to the hospital to learn how to walk on crutches — without putting any weight on my right leg. Even standing on my healthy leg caused pins and needles and cramps.</p>
<p>
Before I had even mastered the crutches, I was sent for a four-week rehab stay in Klimkovice. On my second day, I was heading to my first group program, which all the kids were supposed to attend. In Klimkovice, there are two buildings: A for adults and B for children, connected by a tunnel. A boy who had already been staying there for a while was assigned to guide me. As I hobbled behind him on my crutches, I accidentally stepped on his sliding slipper, lost balance, and instinctively tried to land on my injured leg. I fell and lay there on the floor, staring at my trembling leg, afraid I had messed something up again.
After a few moments, once I had calmed down a bit, the boy helped me get up, and we continued to building A — only to find it completely empty. Turns out the program was actually in our original building, B. As we were walking back, we ran into a caretaker who scolded the boy for leading me to the wrong place. </p>
<p>
Later, I decided to tell the caretakers about my fall — my knee had started to swell, and it didn’t look great. A doctor came to examine me, and since I had previously injured my hip, they decided it was better to send me to the hospital just to be sure. At the hospital, they checked me over — I could still move the leg and there was no real pain — so they gave me a cream and sent me back. The boy who had guided me got scolded again, even though both he and I kept explaining it hadn’t been his fault. That really bothered me.</p>
<p>
By that point, I hadn’t eaten all day. A special meal had supposedly been set aside for me, but someone forgot. Maybe someone got yelled at again — because as an "apology," they brought me three big servings of pasta with meat. I devoured every bite. That’s how my stay in Klimkovice began.</p>
