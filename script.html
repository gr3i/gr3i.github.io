    <h1 class="article-title">Why You Should Start Using Scripts (Even If You're Not a Programmer)</h1>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Let me be honest with you — scripting isn’t just for coders or "tech wizards." It’s for people who are tired of wasting time doing the same thing over and over again. Like… seriously, how many times do you need to click the same buttons before realizing you could’ve automated the whole thing?</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Let me give you some real examples from my own life.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">One of the first scripts I ever used was stupidly simple: I set my laptop to automatically open my browser when I turned it on. Cool? Not really. But useful? Hell yes. It saved me five clicks and a few seconds every single day. Multiply that by how many times you restart or boot up, and suddenly it's real time saved.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">But it’s not just about me. One day, my dad came to me with a very dad kind of problem. He kept repeating the same set of steps in Excel — again and again — and asked if there was some shortcut that could do it for him. I said, "of course." Now, maybe for someone there’s a difference between a script and a macro, but in this case? Same thing in my head. I helped him record a macro and bind it to a keyboard shortcut. That’s it. With a single selection and one keypress, Excel now does the whole operation in under three seconds. He was impressed. I was proud.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Then there was my anime phase. And by “phase,” I mean full-on addiction. I got really curious: How much anime does the average user actually watch? I searched around, but all I found were scattered estimates and forum guesses. So naturally, I wrote a script. It pulled user data from AniList’s API and calculated a real average. I wasn’t just curious — I also wanted to know if I had officially "watched too much." (Spoiler: I had.) I even kept watching to see if I could control the urge to binge. I couldn’t. Now I’ve stopped — if you’re curious why, check my profile on <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/dozby" style="color: #60a5fa; text-decoration: underline;">MyAnimeList</a> or <a href="https://anilist.co/user/Dozby" style="color: #60a5fa; text-decoration: underline;">AniList</a>.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Speaking of time-saving, anyone who’s tried downloading a bunch of PDFs knows how annoying it is: open link → Ctrl + P → save as PDF → repeat. Super boring. I once needed to download a whole manga series for offline reading on the bus — over 100 chapters. So I scraped the page for all the PDF links, dumped them into a text file, and wrote a script that opened each one, saved it as a PDF, added the right number, and moved to the next. I let the script do its thing and I could do something else. Done in five minutes. Doing that by hand would’ve taken me hours. No thanks.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">And then there's scripting on mobile. Once a week, I need to take Vitamin D. I had a reminder on my iPhone, sure, but after each dose I had to manually set the next one. It got old. So I used the Shortcuts app to automate it. Bought an NFC tag, stuck it to the bottle, and now — every time I tap my phone to the lid, a new reminder is automatically set for the following week. No tapping, no scrolling, no forgetting. Efficient and satisfying.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">These are just a few examples. Truth is, scripts are everywhere — you might be using them without even realizing it. If this sounds complicated, it's really not. You don’t need to be a master programmer. With today’s tools like llm, creating a script is more accessible than ever.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">I’m writing this because I genuinely believe more people should try scripting. Whether it's automating small tasks, customizing your workflow, or just solving everyday annoyances — a simple script can save you time, reduce frustration, and honestly just make life smoother.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">So the next time you catch yourself repeating something for the third or fourth time, stop and ask: Could I use a script instead?</p>
