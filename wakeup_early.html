    <h1 class="article-title">Waking Up at 4:30 AM is Not for Everyone</h1>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">When I was twelve years old, I started reading a lot of educational books about everything — health, life, how to learn, how to make progress, etc. Like many of you, I stumbled upon the idea that you can wake up very early — before anyone else — and do something that helps you keep moving forward. So I gave it a try.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">I started waking up at 4:30 AM and began learning programming before school. I wasn’t really sleepy or anything like that. I valued sleep, so I went to bed around 8 PM every day, meaning I still got about 8 hours of sleep.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Before I started doing that, I would normally wake up at 7 AM for school. Waking up at 4:30 gave me the advantage of doing something meaningful as the first thing of the day. At first, it was great. I felt like I was making progress and it was very valuable to me.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">I saw a guy on YouTube who was also waking up early, and during his morning session, he would read the Bible. That somehow resonated with me, so I added that into my routine — two hours of programming, followed by 30 minutes of Bible reading.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">There were times when I went to bed really late, but even then, I still woke up at 4:30 AM and did the work I had committed to. I just didn’t want to skip a session — that’s how dedicated I was. I kept this up for about a year before I stopped. I don’t exactly remember why, but I guess it just didn’t feel right anymore, and I was feeling more and more exhausted. I kept programming, but I started doing it during the day instead.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">You may wonder… why am I writing all of this? Well, four years went by, and something unexpected happened. I was still doing street workout (surprisingly…) and eating mostly healthy — mostly, because I occasionally had a “cheat day.” On those days, I would eat sweets, cake, or something else unhealthy. On one of those cheat days, I ate a piece of cake and had a normal day. But the next morning, I woke up with a really bad headache.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">That day, I had two presentations at school — one in Czech, where I had to talk about a book I read, and another one in Physics. You could say I should’ve just stayed home, rested, and asked the teachers to let me do the presentations another time. But I didn’t think like that. Some of the guilt lies with the teachers too, because I hated when they’d say things like, “Oh, he’s missing today and he just happened to have a presentation… what a coincidence.” So I went to school and gave both presentations. In Physics, the other reason was that I was doing it with a friend and didn’t want to leave him hanging.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">That morning, I told myself that after school I’d go straight home and sleep. The whole day my head still hurt. After school, I went home and went to bed as planned…</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Then came a strange dream. I woke up and saw two paramedics from the ambulance looking at me. It was weird. They told me to sit up — so I did. I felt kind of dizzy, half-listening to them while still trying to figure out if I was dreaming or not. They told me to close my eyes and touch my nose — I did it all fine, as far as I remember. Then they said I needed to come with them. I didn’t understand why and kept asking, “What? Why? What happened?” I needed some explanation. My mom was there too, and I guess because of her presence, I agreed to go with them. Well, “go”… I was dizzy and weak, so they had to help and support me to get to the ambulance. My head still hurt a little.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Lying in the ambulance, I asked my mom what had happened. I started realizing this wasn’t a dream and my thoughts became clearer. She told me I had an epileptic seizure. I somehow accepted that and asked her to explain. She told me she heard a “weird” noise from my room, came to check on me, and saw me shaking with foam near my mouth. She didn’t know exactly what was happening but managed to call the ambulance — more on autopilot than with full awareness, she later told me.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">The rest you already know. In the hospital in Břeclav, I was placed in the ICU, where they monitored me closely. The next day, a doctor decided to transfer me to a hospital in Brno for an MRI. The reason was connected to what I wrote in “My Story” — I had a tumor as a child. The MRI results showed that the part of the brain where the irregular discharges that caused my seizure occurred was exactly where the tumor had been surgically removed. This confirmed that my epilepsy is mainly due to those childhood surgeries.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Since then, I’ve been taking medication for epilepsy. I've had two more seizures since, and both occurred on days when I had a cheat day and went to bed late. My doctor told me that sleep definitely plays a big role and can strongly influence this. She initially dismissed the idea that sugar could be a factor, but after the third seizure — again on a cheat day — even she leaned toward the conclusion that sugar (or the amount of sweets) likely affects it, at least in my case.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Because of the epilepsy, I stopped eating sweets and having cheat days altogether. Since then, I’ve only had one more seizure — in February 2025, when I was preparing for SCIO tests. I was on a call with my sister, who was helping me study. Normally, we would have finished by 8 PM, but that day we went past 9, and I was mentally exhausted. Still, I was used to going for evening runs and didn’t want to skip mine. So I went running, and at one point, I suddenly stopped and began walking in circles. It was weird. My head started twitching, and maybe I even made some noise. I couldn’t control any of it — I could only sort of "watch" what was happening with my own eyes in the background.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Suddenly, it stopped. I didn’t really understand what had just happened, but instinctively I stopped, bent down a little, and tried to calm my breathing. I looked around, trying to make sense of what just occurred. Even though I had my suspicions, I still wasn’t sure. After a while, I started running again slowly, but not even 100 meters later, I decided to walk. I kept thinking. I took out my phone and thought about calling an ambulance — telling them what happened and letting them decide whether to send someone or just give me instructions.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">In the end, I evaluated that since I didn’t have a headache, could walk normally, wasn’t seeing anything weird, and didn’t fall, I’d just return to my student dorm and write everything to my doctor by email the next day. I wasn’t sure how long I had been stopped, so I checked my watch (which I had on during the run) and looked at the data. I found that I had stopped for several minutes — walking in place for about 2.5 minutes, then standing still for another two. I wrote all this in an email to my doctor and later called her. She wanted to check me out, so I went for an EEG a few days later. The EEG was fine, but she slightly increased my medication dosage just to be safe. Since then, I’ve been okay. (Knock on wood.)</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">But what does all this have to do with waking up at 4:30 AM?</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">Quite a lot, actually. I firmly believe that if I had respected my sleep more when I was younger — and if I hadn’t pushed myself to wake up so early in the name of productivity — I might never have had a seizure. Sure, the tumor played a role too, as I mentioned, but sleep had a major influence.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">So if you’ve ever thought about waking up super early — like many books and videos suggest — think twice. If you decide to do it, do it gradually. Go to bed 30 minutes earlier, then wake up 30 minutes earlier. Don’t rush it. Most importantly: get enough sleep. I’m not here to say “don’t do it” or that it’s unhealthy blah blah blah. I don’t really like when people tell me what to do when they’ve done it themselves. I’m simply sharing my personal experience regarding sleep.</p>

    <p class="spaced-paragraph">In many of the videos I’ve seen where people promote early rising, I honestly don’t recall anyone mentioning that it can also have negative effects on the brain or overall health. I’d just like to say — if you ever think about doing it — remember the story of some random guy who used to do it as a kid, and how it didn’t end up having a completely positive effect on him in the long run.</p>
